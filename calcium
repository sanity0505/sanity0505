Calcium is an essential mineral element crucial for various biological processes in both plants and animals. It is the fifth most abundant element in the Earth's crust and is widely distributed in nature. Calcium plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling, muscle contraction, blood clotting, and structural support for bones and teeth.

SOURCES OF CALCIUM 
1.  Dairy Products: Milk, yogurt, and cheese are the main food sources of calcium for most people. These products are rich in calcium and are readily absorbed by the body.
2. Leafy Greens and Vegetables: Certain vegetables such as kale, broccoli, bok choy, and spinach contain calcium. While they may contain less calcium overall, they have a higher bioavailability than dairy, making the calcium more easily absorbed by the body.
3. Fish with Edible Bones: Canned sardines and salmon with bones are good sources of calcium.
4. Nuts and Seeds: Almonds, Brazil nuts, and sunflower seeds are also sources of calcium.
5. Calcium-Fortified Foods: Many food products are fortified with calcium, such as orange juice, soy milk, tofu, and ready-to-eat cereals. These can be good sources of calcium for those who do not consume a lot of dairy products.
6. Supplements: Calcium supplements are available in various forms, such as calcium carbonate, calcium citrate, calcium lactate, and calcium gluconate. However, it is generally recommended to obtain sufficient calcium through dietary sources, and supplementation may be recommended only for specific individuals.
DISTRIBUTION OF CALCIUM ION IN THE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM
Calcium distribution in the body is dynamic and tightly regulated, playing a fundamental role in various physiological processes. The majority of calcium resides in bones and teeth, providing structural support, while a smaller fraction circulates in the blood and soft tissues, participating in essential functions. Here is an overview of the distribution of calcium in the body:
